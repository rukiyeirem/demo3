      <p>
        
        Sephora, founded in France in 1969 by Dominique Mandonnaud, quickly became known as the "Heartbeat of Beauty." Mandonnaud created an experience model inspired by the self-service concept, highlighting the most captivating aspects of the beauty industry, and developed a sophisticated concept to make beauty products accessible to everyone. With its innovative store design, Sephora revolutionized the shopping experience and became the go-to place for perfect beauty.
        Sephora offers a unique range of 250 brands and 16,000 product options. In stores, consumers have the opportunity to touch, feel, and test products, with access to both luxury and affordable brands. Sephora always presents an innovative product selection under its Sephora Collection brand, bringing cutting-edge beauty trends to cosmetics enthusiasts.

With the guidance of beauty experts, Sephora offers makeup & skincare services and fragrance selection, delivering a full beauty experience.
        
      Today, Sephora is owned by the world’s largest luxury group, Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), and operates in 34 countries across Europe, the Middle East, America, and Asia.


        
    Since 1999, Sephora has expanded online, with 17 websites available in 10 different languages, allowing customers to access the Sephora world anytime and anywhere.
